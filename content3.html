      <p> &bull; Short quotes, quotes of less than three lines, should be written into the paragraph and shown by quotation marks: “....”<br><br>
          &bull; Long quotes, quotes of more than three lines or 40 words, should be indented and separated from the paragraph. No quotation marks are needed.<br><br>
          &bull; [ ] Square brackets in a quote show that the writer has added words to the original quote. This may be necessary to clarify what is being said. <br><br>
          &bull; if the quote you are copying comes from a source other than the author of the book you are reading, you should cite the original source then the author you are reading.<br><br>
          &bull; An ellipsis … mark shows that part of the quote has been omitted. This is useful if you don't want to include all of a statement.</p>

        <h3> The ways of paraphrasing </h3>
        </div>
      <div class="panel-image1">
        <img src="image/paraphase.jpg" alt="pic">
      </div>
      <p>Paraphrasing means using your own words to report someone else's material or ideas. You will need to paraphrase when you want to change the style or the language used in the original either to make it easier to understand or to make it fit better into your own piece of writing.<br><br>
        The most effective way to paraphrase is to use the following method:<br><br>
        1. Read the sentence or sentences several times carefully to make sure you understand the meaning. <br><br>
        2. Highlight the key words and phrases. <br><br>
        3. Cover up the original and try writing down the substance of the sentence/s from memory in your own words.<br><br>
        4. Now check the original. Make sure you did not leave out anything important or added something that isn't there.<br><br>
        5. Check your wording. Make sure you have not used the same words as the original. If you have, change them.<br><br>
        6. If the original contains a phrase that you find particularly striking and you do not want to change this expression, put quotation marks around it and only paraphrase the rest. Do not overuse quotes though as you will lose the flow of your writing.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Summarising</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <h3> The ways of Summarising </h3>
      <div class="panel-image1">
        <img src="image/summarising.jpg" alt="pic1">
      </div>
      <p>A summary, as compared to a paraphrase, is always much shorter that the original text. When you write a summary, you limit yourself to giving your readers only the main idea/argument of an article or chapter of a book.<br><br>
        To write a good summary, keep the following points in mind:<br><br>
        1. Read the original carefully ensuring that you understand the extract.<br><br>
        2. Mention the author (and date) at the beginning of the summary and add again if you need to remind the reader that you are summarising another person’s ideas.<br><br>
        3. State the author's main idea without distorting those ideas or adding your own.<br><br>
        4. State the author's most important supporting evidence or sub-points without distorting them. Do not include details.<br><br>
        5. Use your own wording. If there is a phrase in the original text that is especially striking, interesting, or controversial, or really cannot be changed without distorting its meaning, use the author's exact words. Make sure however that you put quotation marks around them if you do.<br><br>
        6. Don't include your own ideas or comments (editorial remarks). The summary should include only the author's ideas.<br><br>
